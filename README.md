# Table-using-jQuery

Initial table contains 5 lines and 5 columns with read-only values. Besides these 5 columns there are 2 special columns, one on the left side and another one on the right side containing buttons.

If the user clicks on a button from the left column, the row of the table which contains that button will be deleted and all the rows above that row will be shifted down with one row.

If the user clicks on a button from the right column, a new editable table row is added just below the current row.

The user can edit this row and if all the cells from this row are filled with data, the row becomes read-only.
